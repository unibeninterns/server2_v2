#### 3.3.1 Proposal Intake Processing

- Automated metadata extraction
- Field classification and categorization
- Keyword identification and tagging
- Initial completeness check
- Now when a proposal is to be put for review, to promote fairness and anonymosity, certain information like the name of the reviewer or the reviewer faculty or department, basically all information not part of the actual research proposal requirement should not be added in the proposal to be assigned to reviewers, and my staff proposals are easy to assign since it's in like a form format but for master's student, their entire information is in a document file, whether pdf or docx. so an appropriate way should be found to extract and parse it so it can be assigned to reviewers to after removing the personal information from it, the reviewers don't review documents so the info have to be extracted. If it's a staff proposal that info should be used or if it's a master's student proposal it should be used to be able to differentiate between them since they have some lightly different fields. The master's document follows this set of rules next, it has some slightly different fields from the staff proposals.

#### 3.3.2 AI Scoring Engine (Placeholder Implementation)

- For the initial version, implement a placeholder that returns default scores
